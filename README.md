This is the exercise included in a presentation on Angular Material.  The exercise was meant to show how much of the app could be created just from using cut&paste example code from [https://material.angularjs.org] (https://material.angularjs.org).

To run this application, clone the repo and run:

`bower install`

Then serve the index.html file from the repo location.  Since this is a simple example, there are no other build steps necessary.  Enjoy!
